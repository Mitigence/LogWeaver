#🔥 LogWeaver by Mitigence
Next-Gen AI-Powered Log Parser for SIEM Integration
#🚀 Overview
LogWeaver is a SaaS-ready, AI-enhanced log parser engine that automates the extraction and transformation of infrastructure log files into SIEM-ready formats.

Just upload logs from firewalls, proxies, EDRs, switches, or servers — LogWeaver will:

Auto-detect log type

Parse the log intelligently (zero-regex)

Format outputs for SIEMs like Splunk, QRadar, ArcSight, Sentinel, etc.

Deliver outputs in JSON, CEF, XML, or CSV

This is your one-stop solution for multi-vendor log ingestion and SIEM readiness — no complex configs, no custom scripts.
